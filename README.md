About the project

I've always been a passionate traveller and I like to get to know other cultures and languages. To do so, I believe it is extremely important to know a bit about the culture of the country you are travelling to, and you certainly have to know its capital city! Some people seem not to like studying geography by memorizing, so I decided to create a game that teaches 20 of the most relevant capitals in the world (please notice that this is a personal choice and means no offense to any country, ethnicity, or particular person) in a fun manner. 

I created an interactive trivia game that displays a country's name and flag, and gives you four random capitals to choose the correct one. There is a time limit, so hurry up and try to guess as many as you can. If you are correct, the answer turns green. Otherwise, it turns red and indicates in green the correct choice. There is always a score counter that lets you know how many correct answers you've had. 

The game was designed with Bootstrap and JQuery, as well as vanilla Javascript for the timers. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me ! Enjoy the capital learning...
